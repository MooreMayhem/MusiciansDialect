					<h2>The inspiration behind Prolific Miz's Let It Go</h2>
				</header>

					<p> "I do not mean to be too abstract but one of my favourite writers, Napoleon Hill,
					once articulated a concept called sex transmutation. Basically this is the idea that
					men use the energy they get from being around the opposite sex as inspiration to do 
					creative things. I think that is what happened in the year I created the best music
					of my career so far</p>
					
					<p> So the premise might seem a bit weird but let me clarify. In the year 2012, I was
					involved in a very passionate relationship with someone who shall not be mentioned, 
					but this person inspired a song called Fuck The Industry. The title later became a 
					theme in the mix-tape I was working on that year. You see fuck the industry was a loud,
					arrogant and expressive song that gave me a lot of recognition on my hood. It also 
					caught the attention of a lot of producers who were eager to work with a 19 year old
					boom-bap rap sensation called Prolific Miz.</p>
					
					<p>One specific producer who reached out to me was KaySoul. This guy is a genius 
					neo-soul vocalist, phenomenal producer and dare I say, a close friend of mine. KaySoul
					reached out to me via BBM, sent me a beat and asked me to spaz on it. I remember smoking
					a blunt and listening to this beat while falling in love with the patterns. I started
					writing the very same day and a song called Let It Go was born.</p>
					
					<p>Let It Go is a love letter to the beat but the lyrics(keeping the theme in mind)
					also explored my frustration with how feeble  the artistry in hip hop had become. 
					(So)First you take some old school soul song and sample it, mix it with hardcore
					boom-bap drums then add my sex transmuted mindset inspired lyrics, dash it with light,
					echoed singing vocals for the chorus and you have one of my favourite songs"</p>
