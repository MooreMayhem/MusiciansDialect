					<p>A Musician's Dialect Team favourite. On this one Prolific went hard. This is a different standard of
					music for come up rappers. He sends a big middle finger to the talentless industry that makes it so 
					difficult for talent like his to break through. It's a movement. So Fuck The Industry.</p>

					<p> To all come-up rappers.</p>

					<p>Early in his music career, Prolific Miz wrote and recorded this "get up and do for
					yourself" song. This is the type of talent that the EastRand gives birth to.</p>

				<content>
					<p>Back in high school a 17yr old Prolific put this track out. I was in awe, his ability
					as writer had grown exponentially. By then it was plain to see that the East Rand had a
					great talent in him. </p>

					<p>Enough said, press play.</p>
